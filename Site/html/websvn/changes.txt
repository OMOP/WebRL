CHANGES
NEW: New default template theme offered by Erik PÃ¶hler.
NEW: Template files may now be specified on a per repository basis.
NEW: RSS 'alternate' <link> elements in HTML headers links to directory listing.
     This lets you, for example, easily create an RSS 'live bookmark' to monitor
     commits to a particular SVN path.
NEW: Russian translation

CHANGE: Bugtraq handling has been updated to account for the latest spec.

FIX: Syntax highlighting across lines has been fixed (Issue 85)

2.00 beta 8

CHANGE: Remove path comparison boxes when using the flat view display.
CHANGE: Tidied URLs generated from the listing view (remove default parameters).
CHANGE: wsvn now selects either the listing or file view automatically when the
        "op" parameter isn't present. This allows for simpler, shorter URLS.
        (eg. /http://example.com/wsvn/repo1/myfile.txt)
        
FIX: Fix warnings when using an access file that didn't define a groups section.
FIX: Fix tarballing of directories with spaces.
FIX: Path history information in the log view of a file was incorrect.

2.00 beta 7

NEW: Projects may now be assigned to groups to simplify the index view.
NEW: The index may be displayed as a collapsible tree of groups.

CHANGE: The syntax for per-repository configurations has changed is now much
        simpler and will work on all versions of PHP.

FIX: Various bug fixes for the access rights module.
FIX: Language choice selection with MultiViews enabled didn't work.
FIX: Various small bugs introduced during 2.0 development.

2.00 beta 6

Note: $config->addRepository() now takes a URL, not a filesystem path!

NEW: WebSVN can now host remote repositories!

FIX: The access rights handling didn't work if you had give a repository a
     display name different from it's "real" svn name.
FIX: The deleted file list no longer links to nonexistent files.
FIX: Tidied the directory display when download/compare links aren't available.

2.00 beta 5

NEW: Access rights files can now be specified on a per-repository basis.

CHANGE: Further improvements have been made to character encoding handling. In
        particular, it is now possible to specify the encoding of the repository
        contents separately from the system encoding. This is the case for
        Windows users; the command line tools typically returning CP850-encoded
        strings, whereas the source files are encoded as iso-8859-1. Now, when
        displaying text files, WebSVN will convert from the content encoding to
        the output encoding (UTF-8).
CHANGE: Updated Danish translation.
CHANGE: The log display has a "max number of revisions to show" filter option,
        which defaults to 30. This significantly improves log view performance.

FIX: Correctly display the contents of a file which had brackets in the name.
FIX: Correct problem with download of tarballs containing special characters.
FIX: Improve time display.
FIX: Remove non-UTF8 language options from distconfig.php.

     can be enabled after only a certain directory depth, and directories can be
     (dis)allowed on a per-directory/per-repository basis.
NEW: The user can now choose their language via a drop down box.

CHANGE: Character encodings are now handled differently. The output encoding is
        always UTF-8, and the setOutputEncoding option has been removed.

FIX: Diff was broken by 1.70 beta 2.
FIX: Download of a directory is prohibited if the user doesn't have read access
     to the directory AND all of its subdirectories.
FIX: The character set type is now sent in the HTTP header automatically.

CHANGE: The listing view will now always show the requested revision (HEAD by
        default), but the log message will show the log  string for the latest
        modification to the current directory). This means the parent directory
        structure won't change as you browse through old directories.

FIX: A bug prevented downloading of tarballs from working.

1.60 

NEW: Directory displays are now shown in tree view (so that it's harder to get

1.50

Notes: Before installing this version you should delete existing cache files.
       
       wsvn.php has changed. You should redo any appropriate configuration
       changes inside this file.

NEW: Blame information for a file can now be viewed.
NEW: The cached files are now compressed.
NEW: The project selection box shows the current project by default.
NEW: Swedish translation
NEW: Japanese translation
NEW: The install file explains how to set up permission-based repository access,
     such that access via the web interface is the same as access via a client.
NEW: SVN keywords are now expanded in file listings.

CHANGE: The extraction of the directory listings is now accomplished using the
        'svn' command via file:/// access rather than 'svnlook'. This has the
        advantage of being non-recursive, and thereby eliminates the need for
        caching the entire directory listing, and is much quicker on complex
        directory structures. (Also, no more 50MB directory caches!)
        
FIX: Deleted directories are now viewable.
FIX: SHOWALL was being redefined in the language files.
FIX: The directory listing view sometimes showed [lang:DELETEDFILES].
FIX: Under Windows, links in the RSS output would start with "\" if WebSVN
     was installed in the server's root directory.

     quotes around the parameters.
FIX: Improved character encoding support for log messages etc.

NEW: .exe files now default to content-type "application/x-msdownload".
NEW: Recognised links are now 'linkified' in the log messages.
NEW: Option to change number of spaces to use for tabs in file/diff listings. 
NEW: URLs now access the repository by name rather than number. This means that
     bookmarks will stay the same when new projects are added. The old behaviour
     can be configured in config.php.

FIX: Removed the revision 0 that has appeared since the previous version.
FIX: Repositories were not sorted alphabetically when using ParentPath.
FIX: The PNG support script (and the BlueGrey scheme) is now only loaded for IE.

1.39

CHANGE: In the human-readable date strings, display up to 119 minutes, 47 hours,
        13 days or 23 months before moving up to the next unit, like ViewCVS.

     the file extension was not recognised for Enscript. 
FIX: distconfig.php had a few minor errors in the examples.
FIX: It wasn't possible to call ParentPath multiple times.

1.38

     the line as deleted then added.

FIX: Problem with quoting of commands and command line arguments on Windows.

1.35

NEW: You can now specify a list of file types (extensions) for files that should
     be delivered to the user in a GZIP'd archive rather than displayed as ASCII
     in the browser window.

CHANGE: Files delivered with a MIME Content type are now sent as "inline". The
        browser will try to display them in the browser window, offering a save
        box only if they can't be displayed in this manner.

FIX: Detect use of the HTTPS protocol when using the drop-down box to select
     projects. (-- FIX INCORRECT. USE v1.36 -- )

FIX: HTML files now display correctly on all machines.
FIX: Removed spurious BRs from the file listings.

1.33

There are a few changes to the config file in this release. Copy distconfig.php
to config.php and redo any configuration changes that you had made.

NEW: Recognised non-text files are now delivered to the user as attachments.
NEW: The list of files types to be sent to the user (rather than displayed with
     WebSVN) is now user-configurable.
NEW: File comparisons are now colourised based on the file extension.

CHANGE: Only the Enscript file extensions that the user wishes to override are
        now listed in the config file.

NEW: Comprehensive templating solution.
NEW: Show the age of a revision in the log view.

CHANGE: The youngest revision of the current directory is now shown by default
        (as opposed to the head revision of the entire repository). This means
        that clicking a directory shows the latest changes associated with it.
        Specific revisions can still be selected from a log view.
CHANGE: Only show the leaf name when viewing directory contents

FIX: Fixed error concerning use of pclose()

1.10/1.10a

There are a few changes to the config file in this release. Copy distconfig.php
to config.php and redo any configuration changes that you had made.

NEW: WebSVN now caches information on the repositories. Once a revision has been
     viewed, subsequent revisions use the cached information to display the
     directory structure. This significantly improves the browsing speed.
NEW: German language file (thanks to Stephan Stapel)

1.04/1.04a

Please note that the config file is now stored in the "include" subdirectory.

FIX: Directories in the log view lacked their trailing slashes.

1.03

Note that the config.php file has completely changed in this release, in order
to make it more "future proof" and resilient. You'll need to copy distconfig.php
to config.php redo the appropriate changes as described.

NEW: A 'ParentPath' can now be specified, rather than having to specify the
     directories by hand.

FIX: Rewrite of the file list code. Should now be quite a bit faster.
FIX: Use a more memory efficient algorithm to list file contents.
FIX: Spaces in Windows path to svnlook and diff are now handled properly.
FIX: Calls to external commands such as svnlook no longer require Windows-style
     line endings.

1.02

NEW: Improved command handling to report returned errors. Considerably helps
     initial installation problems.
NEW: Show the author of each revision in the log view.

FIX: Removed the spurious &nbsp; that some people were seeing.

1.01 (5 Feb 2004)

FIX: Files with HTML content are now shown correctly.
FIX: The diff output had the revision labels the wrong way round.

1.00 (4 Feb 2004)
